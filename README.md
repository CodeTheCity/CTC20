# CTC20
The home repository for [CTC20: History and Culture](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/code-the-city-20-history-and-culture/), which is the weekend of 1-2, August 2020. This follows on from [CTC19: History + Data = Innovation](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/code-the-city-19-history-data-innovation/) which was our first online co-design and hack event over the weekend of 11/12 April 2020. 

On Saturday, 1 August, we had 21 participants working on five challenges. The work focused on moving data into WikiData, as well as how to make visualisations of some of the assembled data. 

1. Register of Returned Convicts of Aberdeen (1869-1939)
2. Mesolithic Deeside
3. Mapping Memorials to Women
4. Aberdeen Harbour Arrivals
5. Aberdeen Built Ships

We will collect the details of the event in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/CodeTheCity/CTC20) and you can see the overall number of new entries and edits on the [Wikipedia Event Dashboard](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/CodeTheCity/CTC20-Aberdeen-History_Culture_(01-Aug-2020)/home)

We will use [Zoom](http://zoom.us) session to hold the space and alternated between main room where everyone should be together, and breakout rooms for group work in 90 minutes blocks of time. We then came back together to check in on how teams were getting on, and to share information and offers of help.

We will also use [Slack](http://slack.com) and our Code the City workgroup as the back channel between rooms, and to coordinate the event outside of Zoom. This worked well in the run-up to the event, and also as the jumping off point for each day.
